# Climate Change Belief Classification Model
## Overview
This project involves the development of a machine learning model to classify whether or not a person believes in climate change based on their novel tweet data. The model aims to contribute to market research efforts by providing insights into public sentiment regarding climate change. Companies in the environmentally friendly and sustainable products/services sector can leverage this information to understand consumer perceptions and tailor their marketing strategies accordingly.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model consists of a collection of tweets labeled with binary values indicating whether the tweet expresses belief in climate change or not. The dataset should be split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance accurately.

## Model Development
### Data Preprocessing
Text Cleaning: Remove irrelevant characters, URLs, and special symbols.
Tokenization: Convert text into tokens (words or phrases).
Vectorization: Convert tokens into numerical vectors using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).

### Model Architecture
The model architecture was built using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

### Model Training
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train the model on the training set, adjusting hyperparameters for optimal performance.
Validate the model using the testing set to ensure generalization.

### Evaluation Metrics
Used metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to evaluate the model's performance.
